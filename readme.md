Here is the project requirement to be made using html,css,js 

and what i want is 

I am having a team of 15+ associates in corporate and i want to deal with the project allocation table like for whom which project/product im assigning,

so for these Ex: take this as example like 

products:crr,prs,cch,eff,ah so for these products there will be multiple associates in a month like 

for eg: from jan-25 to dec-25 

all these associates will be tagged to diff products 

and i can also assign them the work percentage like 100% 

so i need u to create a dashboard kind of structure for this 

like and i will be storing the data i mean associates names in excel so just we need to read the associates names from excel

no backend for this 

but when ever we modify the montly status like for some assocaites in a month need to be updated
